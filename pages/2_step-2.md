-----------------------------------------------------

Conducting a policy analysis will help you better understand the existing access control expectations and limitations, the selection and implementation of access control measures, and supporting enablers to protect your agency’s resources.  Understanding your policies across the enterprise will help you update existing policies and draft new ones to support your agency’s access control needs.


### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze existing policies.** Review your agency’s access management policies to determine if they are aligned with the broader access control goals and objectives. This will help you determine if your agency should develop new policies to enforce appropriate access control requirements agency-wide.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish baseline access control policies.** You should establish baseline access control policies that define minimum security requirements at the enterprise level. This helps you establish access control standards for protecting agency resources across the enterprise. Below are a few access control management policy examples.
